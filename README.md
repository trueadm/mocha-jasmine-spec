# Mocha Jasmine Spec

## Overview

This package provides a compatibility layer to application's tests that are all written in Jasmine 1.3 format, allowing them to run in Mocha. Jasmine 1.3 has an older specification for handling async behaviour in tests (typically done with `runs`, `waitsFor` and `waits`) and has its own assertion and expectation API. With this package, Jasmine 1.3 tests should work in the latest version of Mocha.

## Install:

```npm install BladeRunnerJS/mocha-jasmine-spec```
